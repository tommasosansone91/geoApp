the tiff app is the one completely working as,
after defining the entires/configs for geoserver, and having the tiff file, 
it load the file in geoserver

the shp app is not working completely alone as,
after defining the entires/configs for geoserver, and having the shp file,
the shp file must be loaded into geoserver using the postgis extention.
this must be dove via pgadmin, 

but i want to change this.
